# zsh-cursor-mode
This is a very simply zsh plugin that changes the cursor based on the current vi mode. If you are in **insert** mode the cursor becomes a **I-Beam**, if you are in normal mode the cursor will be a **Block**. I created this plugin because I often forgot in which mode I currently was.

This plugin is for vi-mode, if you use emacs-mode this plugin is probably not for you.
